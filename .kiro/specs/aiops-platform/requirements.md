# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AIOps Platform is an intelligent DevOps automation system that provides a centralized dashboard and AI-powered agents to handle routine infrastructure management tasks. The platform aims to automate 90% of traditional DevOps workflows including Terraform management, Kubernetes scaling, incident response, and cost optimization, while providing visibility and control through an intuitive web interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a centralized dashboard to monitor all infrastructure automation activities, so that I can maintain visibility and control over AI-driven operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time status of all active AI agents
2. WHEN infrastructure changes occur THEN the system SHALL log all actions with timestamps and reasoning
3. WHEN incidents are detected THEN the system SHALL show incident severity, affected resources, and resolution status
4. WHEN cost optimizations are performed THEN the system SHALL display savings achieved and recommendations applied

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want AI agents to automatically detect and fix Terraform configuration drift, so that infrastructure remains consistent without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform state drift is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze the differences
2. WHEN drift can be safely resolved THEN the system SHALL apply corrections and update state
3. WHEN drift requires human approval THEN the system SHALL create an alert with recommended actions
4. WHEN corrections are applied THEN the system SHALL validate the changes and confirm successful remediation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want AI agents to predictively scale Kubernetes workloads, so that applications maintain optimal performance while minimizing costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource usage patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL predict future scaling needs
2. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust pod replicas and resource limits
3. WHEN scaling decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log the reasoning and metrics used
4. WHEN scaling actions complete THEN the system SHALL monitor results and adjust algorithms if needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want AI agents to automatically resolve common incidents, so that system downtime is minimized without requiring human intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL classify incident type and severity
2. WHEN incidents match known patterns THEN the system SHALL execute automated remediation workflows
3. WHEN remediation is successful THEN the system SHALL close the incident and document the resolution
4. WHEN automated resolution fails THEN the system SHALL escalate to human operators with context and attempted solutions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want AI agents to continuously optimize cloud costs, so that infrastructure spending is minimized while maintaining performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource utilization is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify cost optimization opportunities
2. WHEN safe optimizations are identified THEN the system SHALL implement changes automatically
3. WHEN cost-impacting changes are made THEN the system SHALL track savings and performance impact
4. WHEN optimization conflicts with performance THEN the system SHALL prioritize performance and alert operators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure and customize AI agent behaviors, so that automation aligns with organizational policies and risk tolerance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring agents THEN the system SHALL provide settings for automation thresholds and approval requirements
2. WHEN policies are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to all relevant agents immediately
3. WHEN high-risk actions are configured THEN the system SHALL require explicit approval workflows
4. WHEN agent configurations change THEN the system SHALL audit and log all modifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive logging and audit trails of all AI agent actions, so that I can maintain compliance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent performs an action THEN the system SHALL log the action with full context and reasoning
2. WHEN audit reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive activity summaries
3. WHEN compliance reviews occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed trails of all infrastructure changes
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL correlate agent actions with system events and outcomes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want integration with existing DevOps tools and cloud providers, so that the AIOps platform works seamlessly with current infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to cloud providers THEN the system SHALL support AWS, Azure, and GCP APIs
2. WHEN integrating with tools THEN the system SHALL connect to Terraform, Kubernetes, monitoring systems, and CI/CD pipelines
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use secure credential management and role-based access
4. WHEN tool configurations change THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and adapt to updates
