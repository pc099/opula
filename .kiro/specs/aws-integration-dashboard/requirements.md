# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AWS Integration Dashboard is a comprehensive web interface that enables users to securely connect their AWS accounts to the AIOps platform, manage AWS credentials and tokens, create and configure AI agents, and monitor agent execution in real-time. This dashboard addresses the current gap where users cannot easily integrate their AWS accounts or effectively manage agent operations through the existing interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to securely connect my AWS account to the dashboard by providing AWS credentials, so that I can enable automated infrastructure management without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the AWS integration page THEN the system SHALL display a secure form for AWS credential input
2. WHEN I enter AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key THEN the system SHALL validate the credentials against AWS APIs
3. WHEN credentials are valid THEN the system SHALL securely store them using encryption and display connection success
4. WHEN I want to use IAM roles THEN the system SHALL support role-based authentication with cross-account access
5. WHEN credentials expire or become invalid THEN the system SHALL notify me and prompt for credential refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to view and manage all my connected AWS accounts in one place, so that I can maintain visibility and control over multiple AWS environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the accounts overview THEN the system SHALL display all connected AWS accounts with their status
2. WHEN I select an AWS account THEN the system SHALL show account details including regions, services, and permissions
3. WHEN I want to disconnect an account THEN the system SHALL safely remove credentials and stop related agents
4. WHEN account permissions change THEN the system SHALL detect and update the available services and capabilities
5. WHEN I have multiple accounts THEN the system SHALL allow me to switch between accounts seamlessly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to create and configure AI agents for my AWS infrastructure, so that I can automate specific tasks like cost optimization and incident response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to create a new agent THEN the system SHALL display available agent types with descriptions and capabilities
2. WHEN I select an agent type THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration form with relevant settings and thresholds
3. WHEN I configure agent parameters THEN the system SHALL validate settings and show preview of agent behavior
4. WHEN I save agent configuration THEN the system SHALL create the agent and display it in the agents list
5. WHEN I want to modify an existing agent THEN the system SHALL allow editing with validation and change tracking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to start, stop, and monitor my AI agents in real-time, so that I can control automation and track agent performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the agents dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all agents with their current status and last activity
2. WHEN I want to start an agent THEN the system SHALL activate the agent and begin monitoring its operations
3. WHEN I want to stop an agent THEN the system SHALL safely halt the agent and preserve its configuration
4. WHEN agents are running THEN the system SHALL display real-time metrics including actions taken and success rates
5. WHEN agents encounter errors THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to see detailed logs and audit trails of all agent actions, so that I can understand what changes were made and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access agent logs THEN the system SHALL display chronological list of all agent actions with timestamps
2. WHEN I select a specific action THEN the system SHALL show detailed information including reasoning and impact
3. WHEN I need to filter logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by agent, time range, action type, and success status
4. WHEN compliance reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive audit reports
5. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL correlate agent actions with system events and outcomes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to receive notifications and alerts about agent activities and AWS account issues, so that I can respond quickly to important events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents perform significant actions THEN the system SHALL send notifications through configured channels
2. WHEN AWS credentials are about to expire THEN the system SHALL alert me with sufficient advance notice
3. WHEN agents encounter errors or failures THEN the system SHALL immediately notify me with error details
4. WHEN cost thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL send alerts with spending details and recommendations
5. WHEN I configure notification preferences THEN the system SHALL respect my settings for different types of alerts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to view AWS resource information and metrics through the dashboard, so that I can understand my infrastructure without switching to the AWS console.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the AWS resources view THEN the system SHALL display my EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and other key resources
2. WHEN I select a resource THEN the system SHALL show detailed information including metrics and current status
3. WHEN viewing cost information THEN the system SHALL display current spending, trends, and optimization opportunities
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL show key metrics like CPU utilization, network traffic, and storage usage
5. WHEN resources change THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the display with updated information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the dashboard to be responsive and work well on different devices, so that I can monitor and manage my infrastructure from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for small screens
2. WHEN I use the dashboard on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for touch interactions
3. WHEN I switch between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain my session and preferences
4. WHEN using different browsers THEN the system SHALL provide consistent functionality across modern browsers
5. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle offline scenarios and sync when reconnected
