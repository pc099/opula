**Key Features**:
- Secure connection with TLS encryption
- Automatic secret engine initialization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Health check and connectivity monitoring

### 2. Credential Rotation and Lifecycle Management

**File**: `backend/src/services/credentialRotationScheduler.ts`

- **Automated Rotation**: Policy-based automatic credential rotation
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Background scheduler for rotation tasks
- **Manual Rotation**: On-demand rotation via API and CLI
- **Rotation Policies**: Configurable rotation policies with intervals
- **Lifecycle Management**: Complete credential lifecycle from creation to deletion

**Key Features**:
- Background job processing with configurable intervals
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Notification system (email, Slack, webhook)
- Comprehensive rotation history tracking
- Metrics and reporting for rotation activities

### 3. Secure Credential Injection for Agents

**File**: `backend/src/services/credentialInjectionService.ts`

- **Type-Safe Injection**: Strongly typed credential injection for different agent types
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Credentials fetched only when needed
- **Credential Mapping**: Flexible mapping system between credentials and agents
- **Template System**: Pre-defined templates for common credential types
- **Validation**: Automatic validation of credential integrity and expiration

**Supported Credential Types**:
- AWS (access keys, session tokens)
- Azure (service principal credentials)
- Google Cloud (service account keys)
- Kubernetes (kubeconfig, tokens)
- Terraform (API tokens)
- Database (connection credentials)
- API Keys (third-party services)
- SSH (private keys)

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging

**Integration**: Uses existing `AuditService` for comprehensive logging

- **Access Logging**: Every credential access logged with full context
- **Change Tracking**: All credential modifications tracked
- **User Attribution**: All actions attributed to specific users or services
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate detailed compliance reports
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for suspicious activities

**Audit Events**:
- `secret_created`, `secret_accessed`, `secret_updated`, `secret_deleted`
- `secret_rotated`, `credential_mapped_to_agent`, `credential_unmapped_from_agent`
- `rotation_policy_created`, `agent_credentials_rotated`

## Database Schema

**File**: `backend/src/migrations/003_credential_management.sql`

### Tables Created:
1. **secret_metadata** - Stores secret metadata and rotation settings
2. **credential_rotation_policies** - Defines rotation policies
3. **secret_access_logs** - Logs all credential access attempts
4. **agent_credential_mappings** - Maps credentials to agents
5. **credential_rotation_history** - Tracks rotation history
6. **credential_rotation_jobs** - Manages scheduled rotation jobs

### Indexes:
- Performance-optimized indexes for all major query patterns
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Time-based indexes for audit and history queries

## API Endpoints

**File**: `backend/src/routes/credentials.ts`

- `npm run credential-cli list-secrets` - List all secrets
- `npm run credential-cli rotate-secret <path>` - Rotate specific secret
- `npm run credential-cli schedule-rotation <path>` - Schedule rotation

## Integration with Main Application

**File**: `backend/src/index.ts`

The credential rotation scheduler is automatically started when the application starts:

```typescript
// Start the Credential Rotation Scheduler
try {
  const rotationScheduler = new CredentialRotationScheduler();
  await rotationScheduler.initialize();
  rotationScheduler.start();
  console.log('Credential Rotation Scheduler started successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to start Credential Rotation Scheduler:', error);
  console.log('Continuing without Credential Rotation Scheduler...');
}
```
